## Smart City (My Problem) Model

The problem to be solved is determining if a large reduction in price will persuade shoppers to by produce that is nearing its sell by date but is still edible to help reduce food waste.

The code files are in the code folder, I could not get a link to work to a folder with the code files.  They are labeled smvegetable.py, smfruit.py, Fruit1.py and vegetable1.py. 

smvegtable and smfuit intialize the class.  Fruit1 and vegtable1 are instances of the Fruit and vegetable class.
