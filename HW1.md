## General Introduction

A **smart city** is an urban area that uses different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently.

(remove: States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(remove: Add real-world examples, if any)
(remove: Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

Orlando, home of the free, home of the brave, home of Mickey Mouse but more importantly home to people who work, live and play in the city and its surrounding areas.  The people who live in Orlando have the same basic necessities of needing a place to live, needing to work and needing to eat.  To satisfy the need to eat, Orlando residents can go out to eat at a restaurant or buying food at a local supermarket to take home to cook and eat.  Supermarkets are a wonder of the modern world in their ability to provide cosumers with year round choices of produce regardless of season the modern consumer has become accustomed to being able to buy whatever produce they want at anytime of the year. 

The ability to use the global economy to procure produce is a remarkable feat by the supermarket but its does come with a downside in terms of food waste.  To satisfy the consumer's demand for choice, supermarkets must keep their shelves stocked with a multitude of products but this can lead to an overabundance of stock that must be thrown away when it is no longer fit for sale to the public.   On top of this we, the consumer, have become very accusted to only buying the best looking produce or what we have been told is the best looking and will shun the items that do no meet this criteria even if they are still edible.  

Finding a solution to getting this produce sold to cut down on food waste is an important topic to understand and try and solve due to the amount of food wasted in the US annually which is estimated by the USDA to be around 30-40 percent (https://www.usda.gov/oce/foodwaste/faqs.htm).  This problem is more than just a waste of resources and money by the population, it impacts the amount of farm land needed to grow the food, space taken up in landfills and it effects our food security (https://www.usda.gov/oce/foodwaste/faqs.htm).

The statistics above are for both the retail and consumer side and both have parties have a role to play in reducing food waste.  The focus will be on the retail side and how they could improve their ability to sella greater majority of produce received.  One solution I have witnessed first hand is the selling of blemished, older produce at drastically reduced prices to persuade customers to buy to prevent the produce from being discarded.  The produce was still edible it just was not quite as fresh as the full priced items and did not necessarily look as pretty. I myself have done this at supermarkets when I lived out in California and they did this.

The focus of the simulation will be to determine if reducing the price on older/blemished produce will help to sell more of the inventory than current methods.

## Requirements (Experimental Design)

(remove: You should start by specifying a set of requirements. I specified a topic Smart Cities but what exactly does that mean-  you should practice formulating your own set of requirements and an experiment. Define a hypothesis of a problem cities face and how a smart city would possibly help alleviate this issue. This helps you think about your problem communication and system objectives inputs, functions, and outputs - they should be clearly specified.)

The purpose of this simulation is to determine if selling older and blemished produce at reduced prices (i.e. %50 off, 75% off) will increase the amount of produce purchased and reduce the amount of produce thrown away due to the produce going beyond its sellable date.

A Smart City would help in this area due to its ability to keep track of large data sets and have these data sets organized in a predetermined way.  The Smart City would allow stores to track not only quantity of inventory but also how old an item was when it was sold.  THis would allow a store to see at what price point an item will see based on if it is blemished or older than the fresh produce that just arrived.  By tagging certain items the store can see the speed at which items sell to help determine a more optimal reordering cycle that reduces the amount of excess items that are brought in to sell.

Inputs to the system would be the amount of produce in the store, the age of the produce and the price of the produce.  The outputs would be the amount of produce sold, the age when sold and the price it was sold.



## Smart City (My Problem) Model

(remove: add a high-level overview of your model, the part below should link to the model directory markdown files)
(remove: Look at the [**Object Diagram**](model/object_diagram.md) for how to structure this part of Part 2 for each diagram. Only the Object diagram has the template, the rest are blank. )

* [**Object Diagram**](model/object_diagram.md) - provides the high level overview of components
* [**Class Diagram**](model/class_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)
* [**Behavior Diagram**](model/behavior_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)
* [**Agent / User case** (if appropriate)](model/agent_usecase_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)

## Smart City (My Problem) Simulation

(remove: for part 3 add two to three sentences here and link the [**(your own name)**](model/README.md) file in the analysis folder - which describe how you would simulate this - type of simulation, rough details -inputs, outputs - how it will help you analyze your experimental hypothesis, or nullify your null hypothesis.)

In order to test the hypothesis about whether selling older, blemished produce at a lower price point will reduce food waste a simulation of supermarket will be created.  The simulation will focus on the produce department.  Full simulation details are here.
