## General Introduction

A **smart city** is an urban area that uses different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently.

(remove: States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(remove: Add real-world examples, if any)
(remove: Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

Orlando is a bustling city in which a lot of people associate with Mickey Mouse and the 4 parks he runs around and the swarms of tourists that come visit him every year.  However, Orlando is home to people who live, work and play in the area and thus must meet basic needs of having place to live and procuring things to eat.  For most residents of Orlando, procuring things to eat means either going to a restaurant or buying food at a local supermarket and then taking the food home to cook.  Supermarkets, with our interconnected global economy, are able to provide almost any type of food year round to provide many different choices for the consumer.  Now this choice rates very high with the modern consumer as they can buy and prepare whatever they want anytime of yea.

The downside to this type of design is that supermarkets must stock a multitue of food that may not get bought before it is no longer sellable to the public.  On top of this we, the consumer, have become very accusted to only buying the best looking produce or what we have been told is the best looking and will shun the items that do no meet this criteria even if they are still edible.  

Find a solution to getting this produce sold to cut down on food waste is an important topic to understand and try and solve due to the amount of food wasted in the US annually.

One solution that I have witnessed first hand is to have produce that is blemsihed or not quite as fresh be heavily discounted.  This could persuade consumers to overlook the blemish, when it has no bearing on the item, and purchase it because it is not at full price.  I myself have done this at supermarkets when I lived out in California and they did this.

The goal of is to simulate consumers buying produce based on its quality, which in this model is based on number of days produce has been on the shelf.  T

## Requirements (Experimental Design)

(remove: You should start by specifying a set of requirements. I specified a topic Smart Cities but what exactly does that mean-  you should practice formulating your own set of requirements and an experiment. Define a hypothesis of a problem cities face and how a smart city would possibly help alleviate this issue. This helps you think about your problem communication and system objectives inputs, functions, and outputs - they should be clearly specified.)

## Smart City (My Problem) Model

(remove: add a high-level overview of your model, the part below should link to the model directory markdown files)
(remove: Look at the [**Object Diagram**](model/object_diagram.md) for how to structure this part of Part 2 for each diagram. Only the Object diagram has the template, the rest are blank. )

* [**Object Diagram**](model/object_diagram.md) - provides the high level overview of components
* [**Class Diagram**](model/class_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)
* [**Behavior Diagram**](model/behavior_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)
* [**Agent / User case** (if appropriate)](model/agent_usecase_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)

## Smart City (My Problem) Simulation

(remove: for part 3 add two to three sentences here and link the [**(your own name)**](model/README.md) file in the analysis folder - which describe how you would simulate this - type of simulation, rough details -inputs, outputs - how it will help you analyze your experimental hypothesis, or nullify your null hypothesis.)
